# Welcome to Sigma

> “In the deep of winter the lone wolf shall perish, it is the pack that survives.”

The Sigma Alliance is a multi-platform gaming community, dedicated to collaboration, success blueprinting, leadership support, and a performance driven approach to our progression as gamers.

Over the course of our journey, we’ve managed to improve our gaming process through our tried and true methods for organization and guidance. Aspects such as our proprietary and centralized form of leadership, gaming support infrastructure, a profound understanding of community health and development, as well as many other factors give us the competitive edge necessary for success at both alliance and player levels. Though we take the SIGMA community very seriously, one of its foremost goals is to imbue our time investment with fun, passion, and the pursuit of excellence.
