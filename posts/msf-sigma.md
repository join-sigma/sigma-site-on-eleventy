summary: The purpose is to create an environment to encourage any type of movement desired by the individual member. For example, a player whose focus is aggressive growth would not be a good fit for a low growth alliance. Rather than that player choosing to leave, they are encouraged to apply and specify the power or specs of an alliance and can move up.

## The Sigma philosophy:
The purpose is to create an environment to encourage any type of movement desired by the individual member. For example, a player whose focus is aggressive growth would not be a good fit for a low growth alliance. Rather than that player choosing to leave, they are encouraged to apply and specify the power or specs of an alliance and can move up.

The goal is to retain all players who want to put in the effort to make their experience the best they can. If one alliance doesn't meet their needs, we can find them another home with a different alliance better suited for their playing style.
