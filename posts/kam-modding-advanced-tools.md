Everyone should be familiar witht he in-game inerface for handling mods, equipping them, locking them and so forth. There is another layer to mods management that CG kindly offered to us - it's called mods loadouts where you can save whole set of mods that can be equipped on characters.

For purpose of KAM mission, this comes especially handy, as you can save mod loadouts from teams that characters in KAM mission will pull mods from and than restore things back to previous state in somewhat sane way.

##  So how does one go about creating mods loadouts?

Simplest way to do it is directly from character screen, where you simply create new loadout via few taps.

1. tap on mods,
2. find and tap on 'loadouts' button
3. tap on + graphics where your characters is visible too (that's second option)-> your loadout is created

This means mods were already applied to characters, which ins't ideal when you just want to create mods loadouts for future use. Thanfully we have 

## But



While in-game UI for dealing with mods covers all the bases, it's often cumbbersome for longer modding sessions

If you want to elevate your modding experience some, compared to user interface for dealing with mods in-game, you can use some of the tools out there - for sake of this post, we'll mention two: grandivory and playgroung in HotUtils.


2. With playground HotUtilsWith advanced tools (Grandivoy + HotUtils)

1. create 5 man KAM template (I haven't figure out how to do so in HotUtils so I go to GrandIvory via HotUtils and add KAM team, click optimse and save it to HotUtils),
2. Load this 5 man team in playground with Ally code (you'll not have only 5 KAM chars to fool around with in playground)
3. tap on one of them, tap on filter icon on upper right side and add health primary values etch... than go to town. Don't forget you can sort by speed etc.
4. Once you happy with one character confirm loadout on upper left side and swap to anotehr character
5. click Save -> selec create new loadout and name it after player you're trying to sort mods for..
6. once you're happy click on image icon to generate loadout image/preview 
7. save once again, than save with export option to get .json file (all settings will be retained in that)
