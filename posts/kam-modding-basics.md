While we're talking mods, did you know you can make in-game mod loadout without actually moving mods between chars?

I know some rare reluctant to prepare mod louadouts in advace, mostly as they feel they need to actually move mods around to create loadouts but we can actually make mod loadouts without moving mods left and right.

Also, if one ticks 'uniqe only' this would prevet from same mods getting saved in multiple loadouts.

When you go into creation of loadout, you can create one from scratch or apply currently equipped mods on character into loadout.

You can try is this way:

0. enter characters, tap mods, tap loadouts to enter loadouts UI
1. make new mod loadouts category
2. tap on 'unique only' (on left upper corner)
3. tap 'Create New Loadout' graphic/button
4. assign few mods
5. go back and again tap 'Crete New Loadout' (mods applied to previous loadout in this category will not show up as available now)
